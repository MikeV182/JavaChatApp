# JavaChatApp

This app is not working yet, during the process of creation it, i realized that i need to practise some Java fundamentals first, before that app i didn't even write a single algorithm on Java or on any OOP languages. Some concepts were pretty understandable, but soonly i found out that i don't understand: threads, classes and OOP concepts, buffers and some other things.

But i really enjoyed the flow during first two versions of my project, so i decided to come back here later, when i become more experienced as a Java developer.
